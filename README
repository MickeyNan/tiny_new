Tiny Web server
The author is Mickey Nan form China

This is a extremely  clean and small server providing static and some dynamic service.

This software takes the CMU Understanding the Computer System from a Programmerâ€™s Perspective as a reference. And some new and more powerful ability(multi process ,process-poll and thread-poll, further more the aio and Linux-epoll will also be considered ) is added to enhance the performance. 

Tiny is neither secure nor complete(such as ssl and other clusters of HTTP is not given ),because till now only the processing ability is considered.
 
This server is tested  under the environment of CentOS 6.5 (a kind of RedHat like Linux OS), and it works well.

Some test index file which is a html file and the test photograph is also packed into this package. ALSO, a test file which is written in python is also provided.
